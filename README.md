The NBA Player Email Bot is a project that helps you keep track of when your favorite NBA player gets into a game, 
so you don't have to watch the entire game just to catch their playing time. 
This project utilizes Airflow, an open-source platform for orchestrating workflows, to automate the process of checking NBA game schedules 
and sending email notifications when the specified player enters a game.
